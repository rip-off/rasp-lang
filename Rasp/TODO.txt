Doing:
* Print line numbers associated with execution errors
* Print stack traces for errors in functions?
* Arrays
* SourceLocation(File, Line, Column?) rather than just line
* SourceLocation in InternalFunction?

Known bugs / issues:
* (*) returns 1
* Short circuiting for &&, ||
* Investigate stuff being left over in the stack
* Clean checkout, need to mkdir /obj

Questions:
* Allow overloading? Currently "+" supports strings and numbers

Next:
* Unit testing
** For C++ code
** Native rasp framework?
* Implement advanced data structures
** Dynamic arrays
** Linked list
** Trees
** Set
** Map
* Linking (requires, provides) ?
* "else" statement
* "return" statement
* way to trap errors?
* Assertion mechanism?
* Allow user to include files / modules?
* Unit testing framework for rasp code
* Reflection - scan scope for test_*
* Add a type system?
* Demote nil from value to optional type?
* User defined types?
* Floating point numbers
* String manipulation function
* Dictionaries
* Named parameters
* Nicer repl
** Editing cursor: left & right
** Command history: up & down

Wild ideas:
* Invoke with multiple mains, each its own thread / process

Done:
* Identifier checks
* Booleans
* Loops
* Cleanup keyword handling
* User defined functions
** Local variables
** Arguments
* Non-stupid build system
* Comments
* Some basic stuff
* Conditions
* Variable declarations
